# A-Data-Driven-Study-of-Women-s-Basketball
This project analyzes 2014 WNBA player statistics using predictive analytics like time series and linear regression. Key insights include player efficiency, team performance, and predictive models for game outcomes. The analysis highlights top players and explores factors influencing game results.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes player statistics from the 2014 WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) season. The dataset contains 4033 records with 26 variables representing various player statistics for games played that season. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series models, and regression analysis, the project aims to provide insights into player performance, team efficiency, and predictive models for game outcomes.

# Dataset Description
Dataset Name: WNBA 2014 Player Stats by Game
Records: 4033
Variables: 26
Description: Player performance statistics for the 2014 WNBA season across 12 teams.
Key Variables:
Player Statistics: Points scored, assists, steals, blocks, fouls, turnovers, and more.
Team Performance: Team points, opponent points, wins, and losses.
Game Statistics: Date of the game, team names, number of 3-point field goals made, fouls, assists, and more.

# Objectives
The project explores key business questions, using predictive analysis to gain insights into the dataset:
1. Player Efficiency: How efficient are players in terms of points scored?
2. Team Performance: How well do teams perform throughout a game based on points, assists, fouls, etc.?
3. Predictive Modeling: Use logistic regression to predict game outcomes based on chosen variables.

# Analytical Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand the general trends and distribution of the data.
Time Series Analysis: Performed to observe changes in team and player performance over time.
Linear Regression: Used to analyze relationships between variables such as points, fouls, assists, and player efficiency.
Logistic Regression: Applied to predict game outcomes (win/loss) based on player and team statistics.
Tools and Libraries

# Key Results
Top Player Performance: Identified the top 10 players based on their efficiency metrics (points, assists, etc.).
Team Efficiency: Teams were analyzed based on the points scored and assists to measure overall game performance.
Predictive Modeling: Logistic regression was successfully used to predict the likelihood of a player winning based on their in-game statistics.

# Business Questions Explored
BQ 1: What is the player efficiency with respect to points scored?
BQ 2: How does team performance change throughout the game?
BQ 3: Can we predict a true positive result (win) based on chosen variables using logistic regression?

# Conclusion
This project delivers valuable insights into WNBA player performance and team efficiency, offering predictions based on player statistics. The combination of exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling helps in uncovering patterns and making data-driven predictions.
